# Normalized level set model for segmentation of low-contrast objects in 2- and 3- dimensional images.

These functions demonstrate the normalized local binary fitted (nLBF) level set algorithms in 2- and 3-dimensions described in the manuscript: Mirza M. Junaid Baig, Yao L. Wang, Samuel H. Chung, Armen Stepanyants, Normalized level set model for segmentation of low-contrast objects in 2- and 3- dimensional images.

The functions produce the results for both the standard local binary fitted (LBF) level set algorithm as well as results for nLBF. 

The functions work with MATLAB version 2022a or later.

### Datasets

Also included in this repository are the datasets used:
